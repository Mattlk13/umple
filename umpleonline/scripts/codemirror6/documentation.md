## Codemirror 6
- New code editor library split into different packages
- From-scratch implementation
- All the interfaces are different from V5

## Challenges
1. Undestanding the new architecture
2. Navigating the documentation
3. Lots of functions to understand and work with
4. Since the library is newly implemented, there are very few examples available
